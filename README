Julia Explorer
==============

Simon Peters, 2016.

Written in C++ using SDL2 and GLES2.  Initially built on a Raspberry Pi 3.

Alters view based on XY of the mouse and zooms with scroll wheel
(this is fairly limited at present).

Required are:

GLES2 library/includes at /opt/vc/lib and /opt/vc/include - 
  I believe these are fairly Pi-specific.

SDL2 library/includes at /usr/local/lib/ and /usr/local/include/SDL2


This is my first go at c++ coding in 2 decades, go easy!

I know it'll probably leak like a sieve as there's no cleanup.

Code was adopted and modified from original code here (for the GL/GLES routine):

and here (for the initialisation)
